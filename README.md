# Asaph
Asaph is a toolbox for developing and evaluating algorithms for population genetics analysis of SNPs from insect species.  Asaph is developed primarily by [RJ Nowling](http://rnowling.github.io/).

Build status: [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/rnowling/asaph.svg?branch=plos-one)](https://travis-ci.com/rnowling/asaph)

## Getting Asaph
To download Asaph, all you need to do is clone the git repository:

    $ git clone https://github.com/rnowling/asaph.git

Asaph requires that [numpy and scipy](http://www.numpy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/), [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/), and [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/index.html) are installed.

## Running Tests
Asaph has a test suite implemented using the [Bats](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats) framework.  You can run the test suite like so:

    bats tests/*.bats
