"""
Command-line tool for querying and displaying project summary information from Asaph analysis directories.
This tool reads project summary files containing metadata about genetic analyses, including sample counts,
feature dimensions, analysis parameters, and explained variance ratios from dimensionality reduction.
It provides a simple interface for inspecting analysis results and verifying project configurations
without needing to parse individual data files.
